# 📦 Snippet Vault — Cloud Deployment Project

A code snippet manager app deployed on AWS EC2, served over HTTPS at a custom domain. The stack uses **Nginx** as the web server, **Duck DNS** for a free subdomain, and **Let's Encrypt** (via Certbot) for a trusted SSL/TLS certificate.

🌐 **Live site:** [https://snippetvault2138.duckdns.org](https://snippetvault2138.duckdns.org)

## 🧩 About the App

**Snippet Vault** is a browser-based code snippet manager that lets developers save, organize, and quickly retrieve reusable code — all in one place.

**Features include:**
- ✏️ **Save snippets:** with a title, programming language tag, and code body
- 🏷️ **Filter by language:** supports JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, C, C++, TypeScript, PHP, Go, and Swift
- 🔍 **Search by title:** to find snippets instantly
- 📋 **Copy to clipboard:** with a single click
- 🗑️ **Delete snippets:** you no longer need
- 💾 **Persistent storage:** via the browser's `localStorage`.Snippets survive page refreshes

## 📋 Deployment Overview

The server setup is broken into four parts:

### A. 🖥️ EC2 Instance: Provisioning & SSH Access

A `t3.micro` instance (free tier eligible) was provisioned with the **Amazon Linux 2023** AMI. A security group was configured to allow inbound **SSH (22)**, **HTTP (80)**, and **HTTPS (443)** traffic.

The instance is accessed via SSH using a `.pem` key pair:

```bash
# Fix overly open key permissions
chmod 400 "[private-key].pem"

# Connect to instance
ssh -i "[private-key].pem" [username]@[remote-hostname]
```

> ⚠️ Without `chmod 400`, SSH will refuse the key with a `Permissions too open` error.

### B. ⚡ Nginx: Install, Start, and Enable

Nginx was installed via the `dnf` package manager, started immediately, and enabled to run automatically on every boot:

```bash
sudo dnf update -y && sudo dnf install nginx
sudo nginx -v                   # Verify install
sudo systemctl start nginx      # Start the server
sudo systemctl enable nginx     # Auto-start on reboot
```

At this point, visiting `http://[public-ip]` will show the default **"Welcome to nginx!"** page. Confirming the server is live.

### C. 🦆🔒 Duck DNS + Let's Encrypt: Custom Domain & HTTPS

At this stage the site is reachable only via a raw IP over plain HTTP. Two things are needed to fix that: a **domain name** and an **SSL/TLS certificate**.

#### 🦆 Duck DNS

SSL/TLS certificates cannot be issued for raw IP addresses — a domain is required first. Duck DNS provides free subdomains.

1. Create an account on duckdns.org
2. Register a unique subdomain (e.g. `snippetvault2138.duckdns.org`)
3. Set the IP field to your EC2 instance's **public IPv4 address**

Now `http://snippetvault2138.duckdns.org` resolves to the same Nginx page.

#### 🔒 Let's Encrypt via Certbot

Certbot was installed into a Python virtual environment and run with the Nginx plugin to automatically obtain and configure a certificate:

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo dnf install python3 python-devel augeas-devel gcc

# Remove any system-level Certbot to avoid conflicts
sudo dnf remove certbot

# Create a virtual environment and install Certbot
sudo python3 -m venv /opt/certbot/
sudo /opt/certbot/bin/pip install --upgrade pip
sudo /opt/certbot/bin/pip install certbot certbot-nginx

# Make Certbot accessible system-wide
sudo ln -s /opt/certbot/bin/certbot /usr/local/bin/certbot
```

Before running Certbot, ensure Nginx is configured with the domain name:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Inside the `server` block, add:

```nginx
server_name snippetvault2138.duckdns.org;
```

Test and reload Nginx, then run Certbot:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
sudo certbot --nginx
```

Certbot will prompt for an email address, Terms of Service agreement, and domain name — then handle the rest automatically, including updating the Nginx config to serve HTTPS.
